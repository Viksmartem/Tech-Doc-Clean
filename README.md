## 🎯 Features

- Semantic HTML5 structure
- Clean, readable layout for documentation
- Responsive design using media queries
- Styled code snippets for clarity
- Intentionally minimal styling at standard zoom

## 🎨 Design Note

> The styling of this page has been intentionally optimized for smaller screen widths and higher zoom levels. This subtle design choice showcases responsiveness and adaptability — best appreciated when zoomed in (e.g. 110% and above), simulating narrower viewports. It’s an intentional demonstration of media query responsiveness.
